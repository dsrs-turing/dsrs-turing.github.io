    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p>
	  	Decision Making processes constantly occur in our daily lives, both at an individual, collective and large-scale societal level. Even for machines and AI systems, making autonomous and rational decisions has nowadays become part of their core duties. Decision making often occurs amid highly dynamic, uncertain and data-pervaded scenarios, thereby becoming increasingly complex.

		This conference based in the UK’s Alan Turing Institute brings together international researchers, industry professionals and domain experts to discuss latest trends and ongoing challenges in: 
		</p><ul>
			<li>Human and AI-driven complex decision making, e.g. group and multi-criteria decision-making.</li>
			<li>Role of Machine Learning and Data-Driven AI techniques in supporting decisions.</li>
			<li>Recommender Systems as tools for personalised decision support.</li>
			<li>Interdisciplinary applications of decision making, decision support and personalisation: management, health and wellbeing, smart cities and urban planning, sustainability, government, leisure and tourism, networking and recruitment, etc.</li>
		</ul>


		The event particularly aims at exploring the existing – or potential – interaction between various AI techniques and applications, and state-of-the-art decision support and recommendation approaches. Young researchers (PhD students, postdocs) are particularly encouraged to attend for an opportunity to network with – and receive advice from – leading experts in the field.

To analyze surveillance videos is an important problem. It requires to develop deep learning approaches for automatically detection of objects or actions. 

In this talk we will focus the attention on the real time weapon detection for surveillance videos, paying attention to pistols and cold steel weapon detection.  We will discuss the preprocessing and postprocesses process approaches to reduce the false positives and to improve the overall performance of the detection model.  We will pay attention to the database creation, the illumination conditions preprocessing, the use of binocular images fusion, the similarity among objects, among others.

We analyze the connection between deep learning and data quality preprocessing. In short, we discus about the quality data preprocessing under the premise of “more quality data for better knowledge on the problem and the extraction” and better detection model.">

The quality of algorithmic decisions depends crucially on whether the scores of a machine learning classifier are calibrated: for example, if the classifier's scores approximate the posterior probability over the classes, then the optimal decision rule is to predict the class that minimises expected cost averaged over all possible classes. An alternative view of calibration holds that a well-calibrated classifier calculates the cost parameters under which the expected cost for the instance under consideration is the same regardless of the predicted class; the main advantage of this more general view is that it can be adapted to different loss measures. In this talk I will review recent work in classifier calibration, including the use of precision-recall-gain curves to obtain scores calibrated for the F-score, and Beta-calibration which is suited for classifiers scoring on a bounded scale.">

This talk will present various works and personal thoughts on how to measure user engagement. It will discuss the definition and development of metrics of user satisfaction that can be used as proxy of user engagement, and will include cases of good and bad scenarios. An important message will be to show that, when aiming to personalise the recommendations, it is important to consider the heterogeneity of both user and content to formalise the notion of satisfaction, and in turn design the appropriate satisfaction metrics to capture these. One way to do this is to consider the following angles when developing machine learning solutions for personalization: (1) Understanding intents; (2) Optimizing for the right metric; (3) Acting on segmentation; and (4) Thinking about diversity.">

In this talk, I will present our latest research on computational data analytics approaches to understand, predict and potentially change food decision making in an online context. First, I will show to what extent online food interactions can be linked to real-world health issues such as obesity on a large-scale. After that, I will show how people upload, bookmark or rate online recipes in large online food communities and how contextual factors and biases such as seasonality, temporality, social context or presentation of recipes have an impact on popularity and how they are perceived. Furthermore, I will reveal to what extent these factors and biases can be exploited to model and predict the users’ online food choices. To conclude, I will present some preliminary work aiming to nudge people towards food choices and recent work on learning to recommend similar items from human judgments in that domain employing crowdsourcing.">

In addition, travelling can be seen as an emotional experience. Particularly in the early phases of a travel decision process, users are not able to explicitly express their preferences. Therefore, comprehensive user models are required. In this talk, I present a picture-based approach as an effective and joyful method to implicitly elicit user preferences for tourism products. In this approach, a user’s travel profile is composed of seven basic factors. The scores of these factors are determined by asking the user to select a number of pictures that are appealing to him or her. In addition, I will discuss automated ways for determining the seven-factor scores of tourism products to enable matchmaking for recommender systems. Finally, since travelling is typically a social activity, I will talk about group decision making and show that in order to understand the outcome of a group decision making process new strategies that go beyond the simple aggregation of the initial preferences of the group members have to be applied.">
